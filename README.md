# Propaganda Recognition
Exploration of machine learning algorithms and data mining techniques in order to detect unreliable news sources and articles.

In order to understand the issue that I'm trying to tackle, we should define what propaganda means and what makes news sources unreliable. According to the Cambridge Dictionary propaganda is defined as "information, ideas, opinions, or images, often only giving one part of an argument, that are broadcast, published, or in some other way spread with the intention of influencing people's opinions". So, the news sources that publish such biased information and opinions with this cause are considered unreliable.
